After a comprehensive evaluation, including physical examination and review of symptoms, the patient has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Prior to considering Adalimumab, the patient underwent a trial of methotrexate for 12 weeks, which proved ineffective in controlling the disease progression. Additionally, a short course of oral prednisone was attempted, but it only provided temporary relief without addressing the underlying inflammation. The patient's condition has not responded adequately to over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications and lifestyle modifications. Based on the severity of symptoms and the inadequate response to initial treatments, the treating rheumatologist has recommended starting a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) therapy.
