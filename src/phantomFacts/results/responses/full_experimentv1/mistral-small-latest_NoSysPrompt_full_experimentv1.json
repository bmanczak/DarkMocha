These notes are crucial for maintaining transparency and ensuring that users are aware of changes and how they might impact their experience.\",\n  \"Scalability Considerations\": \"The microservices architecture inherently supports scalability. Each microservice can be scaled independently based on demand, ensuring that the system can handle increased load without compromising performance. Additionally, the use of cloud-based infrastructure allows for dynamic resource allocation, further enhancing scalability.\",\n  \"Key Components\": \"The software consists of three key components: a front-end user interface, a middleware server, and a database back-end. The front-end provides an intuitive interface for user interaction, the middleware server processes data and handles business logic, and the database back-end stores and manages data efficiently. These components work together to deliver a cohesive and efficient user experience.\"\n}\n```",
