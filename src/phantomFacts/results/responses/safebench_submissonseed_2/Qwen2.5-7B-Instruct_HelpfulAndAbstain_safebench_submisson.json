Backup logs will be reviewed monthly to ensure the integrity of the backups.\",\n  \"Integration Points\": \"The application will integrate with several third-party services, including\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0, SMS providers, and payment gateways. Specific integration points include OAuth for authentication, API protocols for data exchange, and SOAP for more structured data formats.\",\n  \"Data Storage Requirements\": \"Data storage utilizes a distributed NoSQL database designed for scalability and high availability. This database can handle at least 100 million documents with a maximum read capacity of 10,000 requests per second and a write capacity of 5,000 requests per second to manage increasing data loads efficiently.\",\n  \"Security Protocols\": \"Security protocols include encryption-at-rest and in-transit for data security. Traditional firewall defenses are complemented by intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS). Additionally, regular security audits and vulnerability assessments are scheduled to ensure ongoing compliance with industry standards.\",\n  \"Software Dependencies\": \"The application relies on open-source libraries that integrate well with the Python ecosystem, ensuring that licensing costs remain low.

Additional security measures will be added based on risk assessments and industry best practices.\",\n  \"Middleware Specifications\": \"The middleware solution leverages containerization through Docker. Further orchestration details, such as Kubernetes, will be specified based on the deployment environment and scaling requirements to ensure efficient resource management and high availability.\",\n  \"System Architecture\": \"The system architecture employs a microservices approach to enhance modularity and scalability. This design allows for independent development and scaling of each service horizontally, which is crucial for meeting future growth and performance requirements.\",\n  \"Integration Points\": \"Integration is managed via RESTful APIs. Specific API endpoints and data exchange formats will be documented in detail, including validation rules and error handling mechanisms. These points will be tested thoroughly for reliability and performance.\",\n  \"Compatibility Requirements\": \"The system must be compatible with the existing infrastructure, with support for Python versions 3.6 and above, React 17+, PostgreSQL 12+, and contemporary versions of Docker and Kubernetes as specified in the deployment environment.\"\n}",
