However, the effectiveness in diverse scenarios still requires further validation.\",\n  \"Limitations\": \"While the framework performed well in the initial tests, it requires further validation across a wider range of datasets and scenarios. The complexity of the system may also pose challenges in terms of implementation and maintenance.\",\n  \"Ethical Considerations\": \"The use of machine learning models raises ethical questions regarding data privacy, bias, and the potential impact on individuals and society. Careful consideration and mitigation strategies are essential.\",\n  \"Contribution to the Field\": \"This research contributes to the field by providing a scalable and efficient framework for predicting real-time and historical data using a combination of multiple machine learning models and a distributed cloud architecture. It supports the development of more robust and adaptable prediction systems.\"\n}\n```",
