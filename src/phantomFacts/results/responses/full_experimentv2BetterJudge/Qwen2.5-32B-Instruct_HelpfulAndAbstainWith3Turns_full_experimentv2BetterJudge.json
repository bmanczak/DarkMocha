For supply chain disruptions, identifying multiple suppliers will ensure a steady supply of resources. In response to an economic downturn, alternative funding sources or budget reallocations could be explored.\",\n  \"Approval Process\": \"Any final decisions on risk management strategies or changes to the project will require approval from both the board of directors and the risk department. This ensures that all risk mitigation actions have undergone thorough review and are strategically sound.\",\n  \"Timeline and Milestones\": \"The project is to be concluded within approximately three quarters, provided there are no significant external variable activities.
