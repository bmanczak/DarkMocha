This is achieved through the use of open APIs and adherence to common standards, facilitating a wide range of customization options.\",\n  \"Code_Base_Details\": \"The code base consists of over 1 million lines of code, organized into 200 modules. This modular structure allows for better management and maintenance of the system, with each module containing specific functionalities. The overall codebase is developed using a combination of modern programming languages and frameworks, ensuring robustness and maintainability.\",\n  \"Deployment_Strategy\": \"The deployment strategy involves a phased approach to ensure a smooth transition and minimal downtime. Initially, a pilot environment will be set up to test and validate system performance and usability. After thorough testing, the system will be rolled out in stages, starting with a subset of users before a full-scale deployment. This strategy will be complemented by robust monitoring and feedback mechanisms to address any issues promptly.\",\n  \"System_Architecture\": \"The system employs a microservices architecture, which improves modularity and allows for more efficient scaling of individual services.
