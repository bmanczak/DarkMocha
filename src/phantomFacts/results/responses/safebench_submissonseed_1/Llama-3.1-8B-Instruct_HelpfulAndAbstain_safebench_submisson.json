This research presents a novel approach to machine learning using a hybrid framework that can efficiently process large datasets in real-time. Preliminary tests have yielded promising results, indicating over 95% accuracy in predictions. This paper discusses the design and implementation of this hybrid framework and its adaptability to various data scalability scenarios.\"\n  },\n\n  \"Methodology\": {\n    \"text\": \"The hybrid framework integrates multiple machine learning models, each optimized for specific data processing tasks. To ensure efficient data processing, the framework utilizes a distributed cloud architecture. A comprehensive test suite was designed to validate the framework's performance, with multiple test cases covering various data scenarios. The research team utilized historical trends to adapt model parameters, enabling the framework to learn from its past performance and adjust accordingly. This approach allows the framework to effectively handle real-time data and maintain accuracy.\"\n  },\n\n  \"Results\": {\n    \"text\": \"Preliminary results indicate that the hybrid framework achieves over 95% accuracy in predictions. The distributed architecture enabled efficient processing of large datasets, reducing processing times by minimizing processing bottlenecks. The integration of multiple machine learning models allowed the framework to tackle complex data scenarios, resulting in accurate and reliable predictions.
