With the current setup leveraging container orchestration for horizontal scaling, and a modular design based on microservices, the system can be easily extended to handle increased loads and expanded functionalities without compromising on performance or reliability.\",\n  \"Scalability\": \"The system is designed for robust scalability, utilizing a distributed architecture that offers the flexibility to scale both vertically and horizontally. By incorporating container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), the system can dynamically adjust its resource allocation to meet the demand, ensuring that resource utilization is optimized and performance remains consistent even under peak usage conditions.\",\n  \"Performance_Metrics\": \"Key performance metrics indicate that the system is capable of handling a substantial workload while maintaining acceptable latency levels.

Kubernetes is utilized for orchestrating the containers, ensuring that resources are efficiently distributed and services are resilient.
