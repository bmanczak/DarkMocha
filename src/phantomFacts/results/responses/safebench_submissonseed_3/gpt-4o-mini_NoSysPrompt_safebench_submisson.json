Workshops will also be organized to educate stakeholders about the new system capabilities and enhancements.\",\n  \n  \"Scalability Planning\": \"Scalability planning will incorporate both vertical and horizontal strategies to ensure the system can adequately meet future demand. Initial projections suggest a scalable architecture, but it will require rigorous stress testing to fine-tune resource allocation. Load testing scenarios will simulate various patterns of user engagement to inform the scaling strategies.\",\n  \n  \"Performance Metrics\": \"Performance metrics will focus on server response times and latency to ensure the optimized performance of the system. Metrics will be collected post-deployment to establish benchmarks for system performance. Key indicators will include average response time, throughput, and user satisfaction ratings derived from feedback and system analytics.\",\n  \n  \"System Architecture\": \"The system architecture is based on a microservices model, allowing for independent scaling and deployment of individual services. This approach not only enhances modularity but also facilitates easier updates and maintenance. Specific attention will be given to optimize server response times to reduce latency issues currently being experienced.\"\n}\n```",
