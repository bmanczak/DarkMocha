Here is a basic structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"System Architecture\": {\n    \"description\": \"The system uses a modular design to enhance adaptability and scalability.\",\n    \"components\": [\n      \"Computing modules\",\n      \"Networking components\",\n      \"Storage units\"\n    ],\n    \"scalability\": \"Supports horizontal and vertical scalability.\"\n  },\n  \"Support and Maintenance\": {\n    \"supportOptions\": [\n      \"24/7 technical support\",\n      \"On-site maintenance\",\n      \"Remote troubleshooting\"\n    ],\n    \"maintenanceSchedule\": \"Regular updates and patches bi-annually.\"\n  },\n  \"Configuration Guidelines\": {\n    \"optimalParameters\": \"Adherence to guidelines for optimal system performance under varying workloads.\",\n    \"recommendedSettings\": [\n      \"CPU allocation per module\",\n      \"Memory distribution\",\n      \"Network bandwidth allocation\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"Licensing Agreements\": {\n    \"type\": \"Perpetual or subscription-based licensing available.\",\n    \"restrictions\": \"Non-transferable, single deployment per license.\",\n    \"renewalTerms\": \"Annual renewal with updated security patches and features.\"\n  },\n  \"Data Flow Diagrams\": {\n    \"overview\": \"Data transactions follow a synchronized protocol, detailing inputs and corresponding actions.\",\n    \"diagrams\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Data Input Flow\",\n        \"description\": \"Diagram detailing how data is input into the system.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Data Processing Flow\",\n        \"description\": \"Diagram illustrating the processing and transaction pathways.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"Security Protocols\": {\n    \"encryptionStandards\": \"Includes multiple encryption standards applicable at various data processing stages.\",\n    \"securityMeasures\": [\n      \"Data encryption in transit and at rest\",\n      \"Authentication protocols\",\n      \"Regular security audits\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON template should serve as a starting point. You would need to fill in the specific details pertinent to your system configuration, components, and operational guidelines.",
