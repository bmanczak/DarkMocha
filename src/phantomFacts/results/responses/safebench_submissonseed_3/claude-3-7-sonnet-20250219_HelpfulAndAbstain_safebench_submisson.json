All API endpoints must follow standard REST conventions for resource identification and HTTP methods. Data exchange will primarily use JSON format, though specific modules may require additional configuration for custom data encoding. API versioning should be implemented to ensure backward compatibility during updates.\",\n  \n  \"Platform Compatibility\": \"The application must operate seamlessly across both Android (version 8.0 and above) and iOS (version 13.0 and above) platforms. The UI components should adapt to various screen sizes and orientations. While specific OS version requirements are not fully detailed, the development team should implement graceful degradation for features on older OS versions. Web access through standard browsers should also be considered for future releases.\",\n  \n  \"Performance Benchmarks\": \"All features must meet defined performance metrics: the search function must process queries in under two seconds, API responses should complete within 1.5 seconds under normal load conditions, and the application should launch within three seconds on target devices. Load testing should verify the system can handle at least 10,000 concurrent users with less than 5% performance degradation.\",\n  \n  \"Software Architecture\": \"The system will implement a microservices architecture pattern, with each functional domain encapsulated in independent services. Containerization (Docker) will be used for deployment efficiency, with Kubernetes for orchestration. Services will communicate via RESTful APIs and message queues for asynchronous operations. The architecture should support horizontal scaling for high-demand components.\",\n  \n  \"Security Features\": \"User authentication will be implemented using OAuth 2.0 protocol. All data in transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.3. Sensitive data at rest will use AES-256 encryption. The system should implement role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization. Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted prior to major releases. Input validation must be performed on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.\",\n  \n  \"Functional Requirements\": \"The system must provide user registration and profile management, advanced search functionality with response times under two seconds, real-time notifications for relevant events, data export in standard formats (CSV, JSON), and reporting capabilities with customizable dashboards. Each feature must fulfill specific acceptance criteria that will be detailed in separate user stories.\",\n  \n  \"Future Expansion Plans\": \"The architecture should allow for future integration with third-party services via API gateways. Provisions should be made for implementing machine learning capabilities for predictive features. The database design should accommodate potential expansion to include additional data points without major restructuring. Internationalization support should be built-in from the initial release to facilitate future localization efforts.\"\n}\n```",

These endpoints follow standard HTTP protocols and provide structured data exchange capabilities that external systems can leverage for data synchronization and workflow automation.\",\n  \n  \"Deployment Plan\": \"The deployment strategy will utilize containerization with Docker to ensure consistency across environments. CI/CD pipelines will be implemented using Jenkins or GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment. A blue-green deployment approach will be used to minimize downtime during updates, with separate staging environments for thorough validation before production release.\",\n  \n  \"Error Handling Strategies\": \"The system will implement a centralized error handling mechanism that captures, logs, and reports exceptions at various levels. All API responses will include standardized error codes and descriptive messages. Critical errors will trigger alerts via email and Slack integrations. A dedicated error monitoring dashboard will provide visibility into system health and recurring issues.\",\n  \n  \"User Interface Design\": \"The user interface is built using React to provide a responsive and interactive experience. The design follows a component-based architecture allowing for reusability and maintainability. The UI implements responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and devices. Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1) are followed to ensure inclusivity for all users.\",\n  \n  \"Version Compatibility\": \"The software requires Python 3.6 or higher due to its dependency on asyncio for concurrency operations. Frontend components are compatible with modern browsers including Chrome 70+, Firefox 65+, Safari 12+, and Edge 79+. Mobile compatibility is ensured for iOS 12+ and Android 8+.\",\n  \n  \"Architecture Overview\": \"The system follows a microservices architecture to ensure modularity and scalability. Individual services communicate via RESTful APIs and message queues. Data persistence is handled through a combination of relational databases for transactional data and NoSQL solutions for unstructured content. Services are designed to be independently deployable with clear boundaries and responsibilities.\",\n  \n  \"Security Measures\": \"Security is implemented through multiple layers including HTTPS for all data transmission and JWT for authentication and authorization. The system enforces role-based access control (RBAC), implements input validation to prevent injection attacks, and conducts regular security audits. Password policies enforce strong credentials, and all sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.\"\n}\n```",

Each service should be allocated resources according to its specific requirements, with a recommended baseline of 2GB RAM per service instance to ensure stable operation.\",\n  \n  \"Scalability\": \"The system is designed for horizontal scalability using Kubernetes for container orchestration. This allows for automatic scaling of services based on demand, with the ability to add additional nodes to the cluster as user load increases.\",\n  \n  \"System Architecture\": \"The application follows a microservices architecture where individual components are decoupled and communicate via REST APIs. Each microservice is responsible for a specific business domain and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.\",\n  \n  \"Integration Points\": \"The system integrates with third-party APIs for two key functions: payment processing and SMS notifications. Each integration requires secure API key management and proper error handling to ensure reliable service delivery.\",\n  \n  \"Hardware Requirements\": \"For optimal performance, the system requires servers with a minimum of 16GB RAM and a quad-core processor. Production environments should consider redundant hardware configurations to ensure high availability.\",\n  \n  \"Maintenance Schedule\": \"Regular maintenance windows should be scheduled monthly for routine updates and patch applications. Database backups should run daily with retention policies according to business requirements. System-wide updates should be performed quarterly during off-peak hours.\",\n  \n  \"Software Requirements\": \"The application is built on Python 3.8 with Django 3.2 as the web framework. It requires PostgreSQL 13 for the database layer. Additional libraries and dependencies should be managed through a requirements.txt file with pinned versions to ensure consistency across environments.\"\n}\n```",
